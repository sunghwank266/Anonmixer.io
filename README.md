· Various Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains  

Support for multiple assets allows users to perform privacy-preserving transactions across a wide range of blockchain ecosystems.
# Functionality

The service utilizes mixing pools and time-delayed redistribution mechanisms to reduce deterministic transaction tracing. Key functional characteristics include:

· Multi-asset mixing support  
· Adjustable time delays  
· Randomized output distribution

The legal status of such services varies by jurisdiction, and users are responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations when using privacy-enhancing technologies.
